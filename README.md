## 1. Troubleshooting Missing Daily Data Loads

**Question:**
How would you troubleshoot the issue of missing daily data loads, and what key checkpoints should you consider in the ETL pipeline, database, and dashboard updates?

**Answer:**
To troubleshoot the missing daily data loads, I’d start by getting a clear picture of what’s going wrong. First, I’d check the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and look through the logs for any recent changes, errors, or disruptions. I’d look for issues like changes to the ETL jobs, faulty filters, missing transformations, or failed job executions that could have caused the problem.

Next, I’d make sure the data being loaded is correct and complete. This means checking for any issues like NULL values, wrong data types, or strange special characters. If those checks aren’t already set up, I’d add filters to catch these types of errors early on in the process.

I’d also double-check that the database connection is set up properly. I want to make sure the pipeline is pointing to the right database and that there are no connection issues. Duplicate data or slow loading times are also important to look at, as they can point to problems with the ETL process or data transformations.

The database schema is another important area to check. If there have been any changes to the schema, like renamed columns or mismatched data types, this could break the data load. I’d confirm that the schema still matches what the ETL pipeline expects, and ensure everything is properly normalized.

Finally, I’d review the dashboard itself to make sure data is being displayed correctly. I’d check if there have been any changes to the data source connection, visualizations, or filters that might be causing new data to be left out.

To make future troubleshooting easier, I’d create a checklist of potential issues. This would help me quickly diagnose similar problems down the road and ensure that troubleshooting steps are well-documented for consistency.
